Q1 :  Write a Pseudo code for verify if number entered is prime number.

Begin
	declare Num, PFactor as Integer
	Prompt "Enter the number you want to test for Prime:"
	Store in Num
	set PFactor = 2
	while (PFactor <= square root of (Num)) and (Num not divisible by PFactor)
	begin block
		set PFactor = PFactor + 1
	end block
	if (PFactor <= square root of (Num))
	then 
		display Num is not prime
	else
		display Num is prime
	End if
end
