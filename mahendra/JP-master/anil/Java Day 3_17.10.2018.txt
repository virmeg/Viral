Static variable are actually class variables
Static method is like creating a file at a different location with passing score in it and it will only run once
static {
	//Some code to get value from FILE!!!
	passingScore = 35;
	}

	Collection Interface -  list interface & Queue interface
	Linked Queue - 
	
	study more about constructors
	
	constructor chaining means calling constructors from base class to derived class and it also avoids repetition
	
	
	class A{}
	class B extends A{}
	class C extends B{}
	
	C x = new C()
	
	x instanceof A = TRUE
	x instanceof B = TRUE
	x instanceof C = TRUE
	x instanceof Object = TRUE
	x instanceof Integer = FALSE
	
	B x = new B();
	x instanceof C : FALSE
	
	<VAR> instanceof <CLASS>
	where VAR must be object of "Class" or any of its BASE class
	
	Method Overriding
	methods are in different class e.g one method is in base class and another method is in derived class
	
	overriding can be done to your immediate base or base's base class e.g below
	A
	B
	C
	where C can override B and it can also override A
	
	
	Only CLASS and METHOD can be overloaded or overridden but Variables cannot be overloaded or overridden
	
	
PUBLIC & PRIVATE keywords are used for visibility and not for overriding or overloading

one can mark a method as Private & Final so that it cannot be visible and cannot be overriden or overloaded

Constructors are always final by default and we do not have to mention final.

Abstract - It is not a real class and that no object can be created
e.g  just account cannot be created we have to create either savings or current account and account is just used for identifying accounts

Concrete class is a class which is neither Final nor Abstract

Abstract methods do not have a body and do not require curly braces just function name and parenthesis e.g anil();
Abstract classes are generally used for Generalization and grouping classes which has similar features e.g there is no dinosaur in actuallity but the TREX is actually a dinosaur and all other dina=osaur varieties are grouped using the term dinosaur

Interfaces can only support constants and no variables
class can only implement interface and it cannot extend interface
Interfaces are also called contracts since it allows both parties e.g team 2 is building the backend part and team 1 is building the frontend part then team 1 will have to create interfaces so that the codee written by team 2 is compatible with the code which team 2 has written
Interface extends Interface (More than one also)
Class Implements Interface (Class can implement more than one Interface)
Interface cannot extend a class

Default method is when you go back in time and make updates to the prequal just like Bahubali movie where they showd the 2nd part 1st and the 1st part later

Variable Declaration
<Type> <Variable>

Type Could be : 
	1.	Primitive
	2. Built in Class
	3. User Defined Type
		Class 
		Interface
	
	private Storage
	
Constructors do not have a return type and name of class and name of Constructor is the same
