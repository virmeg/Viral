	DECLARE interest, principal, noofyrs, rate as float
	GET principal amount and store in principal
	GET no of yrs and store in noofyrs
	Get rate in percentage and store in rate
	
	set interest = principal * noofyr * rate / 100

A:

BEGIN
	DECLARE a, original, remainder, reverse as integers
	GET number from user and store in a
	Set original =a
	set reverse = 0
	
	while (a != 0) do
	remainder = a mod 10
	reverse = reverse*10 + remainder
	a=a/10
	end while
	
	if (original == reverse) then
	print "yay! palindrome"
	
	Else
	print "nah! not palindrome"
	END IF
END
