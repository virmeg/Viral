<i>Duke's Soccer Leagues</i> is a non-profit organization supporting
community improvement through the sport of Soccer and its players.
We believe that the spirit of sportsmanship, inherent in the game
of Soccer, can provide a model for individual and social responsibility
within our communities. Duke employs this philosophy by promoting the
growth of our sport while simultaneously raising funds for non-profit,
community-based organizations.

We hope that you will join our leagues to foster your own spirit
of sportsmanship and <i>of course</i> to have some fun.  Please use
