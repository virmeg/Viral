In this demo, you demonstrate the how to build reusable view components using
JSP.

In order to deploy and run these projects, you should have configured the
necessary JDBC resources first, as in the DatabaseDemo project in Lab 10 demo.

Two projects, JSPReuseDemo and TilesDemo are provided. The JSPReuseDemo uses
standard actions to build a template based presentation tier, while the
TilesDemo uses the stuts-tiles tag library to implement the same thing. You
can use both projects to demonstrate the necessary standard actions and tag
libraries.

Once you have deployed the application, you can access the web application by
opening a browser and accessing the following URL:

http://localhost:8080/soccer
