In this demo, you demonstrate how to add the Struts framework to the web application project, and make necessary changes to use the Struts framework.

Two projects, PreStrutsDemo and PostStrutsDemo are provided. You can open the
PreStrutsDemo project, and add the Struts framework to the project, and show
students how the project properties and libraries are affected.

When you add the Struts framework, you folow the default settings for the
Struts framework, and select Add Struts TLDs for future use.

The PostStrutsDemo project is a working projet that has been modified to use
Struts and action classes to implement the project.

You can compare the AddLeagueAction class in the PostStrutsDemo project and the
AddLeagueServlet class in the PreStrutsDemo project to explain,and the web.xml
descriptors in these two projects to explain the necessary changes you should
make for the Struts based project.

You should also demonstrate the struts-config.xml descriptor to explain the
struts configuration, especially the action-mapping element.

Finally, you should demonstrate how to create a Struts action class. For
example, you can create a ListLeagueAction class using the NetBeans IDE.

Once you have deployed the application, you can access the web application by
opening a browser and accessing the following URL:

http://localhost:8080/soccer
