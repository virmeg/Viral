In this demo, you use the ContextDemo project to demonstrate the soccer league
sample web application and explain the following:

1. Use the sl314.util.InitialiseLeagues to demnstrate how to implement a
   context listener.

2. use the web.xml to demonstrate the deployment settings of the context
   listener, including context class and parameters.

3. Use the sl314.view.ListLeagueServlet to demonstrate how to retrieve an
   atribute from the context/application scope.

4. Use sl314.controller.AddLeagueServlet to demonstrate how to set an attribute
   in the context/application scope.

Once you have deployed the application, you can access the web application by
opening a browser and accessing the following URL:

http://localhost:8080/soccer
