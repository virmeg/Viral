In this demo, you demonstrate the how to use JSP custom tags, including
JSTL and a custom tag.

In order to deploy and run this project, you should have configured the
necessary JDBC resources first, as in the DatabaseDemo project in Lab 10 demo.

Once you have configured the resources on the Application Server, you can
open the Database project.

The JSPTagDemo project contains the working soccer league project.

First, you might want to demonstrate how to add a non-standard tag library to
the web application project. To do this, you should explain how to add the
taglib JAR file to the project library, and put the taglib descriptor to the
appripriate directory.

You can also compatre the enter_player.jsp and enter_player_old.jsp and explain
how JSP tag libraries simplifies the JSP page implementation.


Once you have deployed the application, you can access the web application by
opening a browser and accessing the following URL:

http://localhost:8080/soccer
