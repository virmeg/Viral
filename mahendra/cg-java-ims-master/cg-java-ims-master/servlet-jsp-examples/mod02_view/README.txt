In this demo, you show students how to use the NetBeans IDE do the following:

1. Create a web application project.

2. Create a servlet and verify the servlet configuration.

3. Create an HTML page.

4. Build and deploy the web application.


A ViewDemo project is also provided in this directory. This project is a
NetBean project-ized version of the Soccor League example discussed in the
Student guide. other than creating a web application project, you can open the
project, and demonstrate how to do everything else, for example, creating a
new servlet, creating an HTML page, setting the welcome page, building and
deploying the web application.

Once you have deployed the application, you can access the web application by
opening a browser and accessing the following URL:

http://localhost:8080/soccer

In this demo, only the list all leagues link works.
