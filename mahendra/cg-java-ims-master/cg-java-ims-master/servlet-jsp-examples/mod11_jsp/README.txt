In this demo, you demonstrate the how to use JSP pages to implement the view.

In order to deploy and run this project, you should have configured the
necessary JDBC resources first, as in the DatabaseDemo project in Lab 10 demo.

The JSPDemo project contains the working soccer league project.

Once you have configured the resources on the Application Server, you can
open the Database project.

You can use the JSP pages in the project to demonstrate the syntax of JSP, and
you can also use the project to demonstrate how to create a JSP page using
the NetBeans IDE.

You should also point out that with JSP pages in place, there is no longer a
need for servlet based views.

You might also open the web.xml descriptor to demonstrate the mapping from
a JSP page to a URL pattern.

Once you have deployed the application, you can access the web application by
opening a browser and accessing the following URL:

http://localhost:8080/soccer
