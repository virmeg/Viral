In this demo, you demonstrate the Session management capabilities in a web
application.

Two projects, CookieDemo and RewritingDemo are provided. You can use the
SelectLeagueAction, EnterPlayerAction, SelectDivision action classes and
the ThankYouServlet to demonstrate the session management feature. You can
also use the SelectLeagueFormServlet, EnterPlayerFormServlet, and 
SelectDivisionFormServlet classes in the RewritingDemo project to demonstrate
how the encodeURL method rewrites the URL.

Once you have deployed the application, you can access the web application by
opening a browser and accessing the following URL:

http://localhost:8080/soccer
