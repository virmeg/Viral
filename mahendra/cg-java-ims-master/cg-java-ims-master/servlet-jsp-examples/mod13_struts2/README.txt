In this demo, you demonstrate the how to use Juse the validation capability
of the Struts framework.

In order to deploy and run this project, you should have configured the
necessary JDBC resources first, as in the DatabaseDemo project in Lab 10 demo.

The Struts2Demo project contains the working soccer league project.

First, you should open the struts-config.xml descriptor to demonstrate
the addition of the input attribute in the action element, and the validate
attribute set to true to force a user input validation. You should also
demonstrate the message resource property file and explain how error messages
can be customized.

Second, You can use the AddLeagueForm class to demonstrate the implementation
of the validate method in a form bean.

Finally, You can also use the add_league.jsp page to demonstrate the
struts tag libraries.

Once you have deployed the application, you can access the web application by
opening a browser and accessing the following URL:

http://localhost:8080/soccer
