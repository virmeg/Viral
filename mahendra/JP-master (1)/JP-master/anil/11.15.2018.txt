Java Portable

JRE is not portable - For windows we need windows JRE & for linux we need linux JRE
JDK is not portable - For windows we need windows JDK & for linux we need linux JDK
Application if built on Java ver 1.8 then it can only be run on 1.8 or above version of JRE

Java applets are small applications that run in the browser.

Java cannot be used for system level programming - e,g we cannot create a partition using java. It can be used to build applications

Benefits of Java:
Portable
Secure 
Robuts &
Object Oriented

JDK = JRE, JVM, Libs
Dev Tools
javac

Compiler uses files ".java"
and translates in .class file which is also known as "ByteCode"

diff between implicit & explicit

Implicit conversion means the complier will do the conversion and we do not have to convert it
byte
int 
short
long
float
double
boolean
char

Java's widening conversions are
- (Take it from PPT)
-
-
-
-
-
-

Explicit coversion means 


check how bit operator works


Logical Operator
				AND		OR
TRUE 	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE
FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE
FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

TRUNARY Opertator

(x>0)?y:z

where:
	x>0 is relational expression
	y is value for POSITIVE
	z is value for NEGATIVE
	
Example : DA is 15% for managers
below statement is written using turnary operator 
da = (desg.contains("manager"))>.15 : .10;

below statement is the same ask as above but is written using IF ELSE statement
if (desg.contains("manager")){
	da = .15;
	} else
	{
		da = .10
	}

how java identifies which is a CLASS,VARIABLE,METHOD
If a name is followed by a {} - curly brackets then it is class
If a name is followed by a; - semi colon then it is variable
If a name is followed by a() - round brackets then it is method

when two methods have same name then it is called as method overloading
function will return a value - Java is not a functional language so there are no functions in java all are called methods
e.g below

static void drawLine(){
	for(int i=0;i<100;i++)
	{
	System.out.print("-");
	}
	}
	
2nd program where input is taken and it with the same method name drawLine
static vodi drawLine(){
	for(int i=0;i<100;i++)
	{
	System.out.print("-");
	}
	}

	
Local Variable - 
Instance Variable


a class can have a field(variables are also called fields in class) and a method. e.g. below

class <class_name>{
	field;
	method;
}


Physical properties will become Variables
And behaviour will become Methods

Every JAVA file can have MAX ON package statement

Package statement MUST Be FIRST "non-comment" statement in JAVA file

syntax:

package base.child.grandchild;

package com;
package com.mahendra;
package com.mahendra.project1;

always declare variables as private and methods as public
